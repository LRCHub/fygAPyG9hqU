There's a family Bible on the table
Each page is worn and hard to read
But the family Bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories

At the end of day when work was over
And when the evenin' meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family Bible
And we'd count our many blessings, one by one

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me

Now this old world
Of ours is filled with troubles
This old world would also better be
If we'd found more Bibles on the tables
And mothers singin' rock of ages, cleft for me

I can see us sittin' round the table
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singin'
Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me

Rock of ages
Rock of ages cleft for me
